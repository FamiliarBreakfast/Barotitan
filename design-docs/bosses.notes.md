# Todo: More bosses (total of 3 + endworm?)

## Boss 2: Parasite
*Microscopic organism similar to bacteria. Replicates using thermal energy.*

Infests the nervous system in humans. Slowly replicates until the spinal cord bursts open, killing the player and rendering their body a zombie.  When exposed to fire, replicates rapidly and explodes, sending itself everywhere. Can be vaporized by very high energy weapons, or within reactor chambers.
Causes symptoms similar to rabies, interfering with the nervous system, primarily in the spinal cord. Causes madness upon reaching the brain.
- Similar to rabies, not curable once crossing the into brain

Before entering the brain:
- Tremors
- Discomfort
- Nausea/Vomiting
- High Fever + Chills
- Mild Confusion
- Dark sores across the back. Can burst, sending the organism outwards. Can be bandaged to prevent bursting

After entering the brain:
- All previous symptoms
- Psychosis
- Extreme thirst/Phlebophagia
- Seizures
- Violence towards others
- Biting (spreads infestation)

Needs some kind of weakness? Possibly radiation? Shouldn't be totally onesided.
Can be treated with antiparasitics, or dedicated medicine made from those who succumbed to the infection. Slowed with cryotherapy. No immunity, as body is incapable of destroying the alien infection.

## Final boss: Endworm
*Lower Titanian leviathan responsible for drilling the tunnels between Lower and Upper Titan. Capable of surviving extreme climates.*

Largely similar to vanilla endworm. Massive, extremely dangerous, and very good at destroying hulls.
- Possibly has babies leading up to fight

Requires direct hit by nuclear weapon to kill.
